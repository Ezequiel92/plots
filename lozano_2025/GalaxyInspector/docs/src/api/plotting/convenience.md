# Convenience functions

These functions are pre-made recipes for specific plots.

They are also examples of how to use the more configurable, but much more complicated, [pipeline](https://ezequiel92.github.io/GalaxyInspector/dev/api/plotting/pipelines/) functions.

All these functions are exported.
